// Overview

I want to research Machine Learning in F1 motorsport as a data analysis. It’s more like if
F1 had a new team, and I’m the lead data analytical engineer for their team.

Pretty much I have the saying on which direction the team should be heading in
everything when it comes to data collecting, and analysis.

What kind of data I would be gathering such as for speed, engine rpm, fuel, tire
temperatures, and so on.

What are some machine learning models available? Linear Regression, Random Forests,
Neural Networks, or others.

How would the team be storing their data, and then what kind of database on a cloud
platform will they be using such as AWS, GCP, Azure, or others.

Overall acting as a data scientist for the formula 1 team. The links below are the 3 I have
chosen, 2 research papers, and one website about machine learning. 
There’ll probably be more
when I research what is the best platform, storage, and database for that given team
